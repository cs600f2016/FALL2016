# PROJECT FINN

Project FINN is a scavenger hunt, meets an arts and crafts class, meets a virtual galleryâ€¦ Users can create teams to participate in Art Challenges. These challenges are made up of randomly chosen prompts and a list of randomly chosen materials.
 
The rules are simple. In order for a challenge to be completed, each team must create a piece of art that answers the prompt and uses at least all of the materials listed within an allotted time frame. Users can join a team by using a token that is sent to them from a team leader via text or email. Post-Challenge, teams can share their creations in the Gallery and see what other teams have come up with!
